# CHALLENGE1

## Description

This motivation for this project was to practice coding skills we have learned during our first weeks of bootcamp.
We want to adhere to the Scout rule and leave the code we worked on cleaner than when we started working on it.
We built this project to refactor code and simplify for future users
This solved the problem of a over complicated code.
I learned that there are a lot of different ways to write code but there is also a standard that we should follow.
When we follow a standard, the code is easier to understand, manipulate, fix, etc.


## Installation

The website was already working well but the goal was to refactor without disrupting the working elements

## Usage

Refactor while maintaining original layout and function
    ```md
